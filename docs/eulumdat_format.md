# EULUMDAT File Format

## What is an EULUMDAT file?

An EULUMDAT file is the standard digital representation of a luminaire's **photometric data**. It serves as the interface between two worlds:

- **Measurement** — a goniophotometer rotates the luminaire (or a mirror system) through hundreds of angular positions and records the luminous intensity in every direction
- **Simulation** — lighting design software such as DIALux and Relux imports the file to simulate how the luminaire will illuminate a space

Without this file, a luminaire is a physical object. With it, it becomes a digital model that can be placed, aimed, and evaluated in any virtual environment.

Defined by the **LiTG** (Deutsche Lichttechnische Gesellschaft) in **1990**, EULUMDAT has remained the dominant photometric file format in Europe for over three decades. Despite its age, it is still the format of choice for luminaire manufacturers, test laboratories, and lighting designers today — a testament to its simplicity and the inertia of a well-established ecosystem.

From a technical standpoint, an EULUMDAT file is nothing more than a **plain text file**: every value is human-readable, the structure is line-based, and no proprietary software is needed to open or generate one. This simplicity is one of the key reasons for its longevity.

### What the file contains

An EULUMDAT file stores:

- **Luminous intensity distribution** — the core of the file: a polar matrix of intensity values I(C, γ) in cd/klm, measured across all C-planes and γ-angles. This is the mathematical description of how the luminaire emits light in every direction.
- **Lamp data** — rated flux (lm), power (W), colour temperature (K), colour rendering index
- **Luminaire geometry** — physical dimensions of the luminaire and its luminous area
- **Photometric factors** — light output ratio (LORL), downward flux fraction (DFF), direct ratios

### The measurement chain

      │  measures I(C, γ) in cd

      ▼

```

### Why cd/klm and not cd?

Intensity values are stored in **cd/klm** (candela per kilolumen of rated lamp flux) rather than absolute candela. This makes the file independent of the actual lamp installed: the simulation software multiplies by the real lamp flux to obtain absolute values. It also allows the same photometric file to be used with lamps of different flux levels.

## File structure

The file consists of a fixed-structure header followed by the angular grid
and the intensity table.

> ⚠️ **Strict line-by-line format**
>
> The EULUMDAT format is **positional**: each piece of data must appear on the correct line, in the correct order. There is no key-value syntax, no delimiters between sections, and no tolerance for missing or reordered lines. A single missing line, extra blank line, or misplaced value will produce a file that DIALux, Relux, and other lighting software will reject or misinterpret — often without a meaningful error message.

> **Real-world variations:** In practice, manufacturers do not always follow the spec strictly. Observed deviations include: empty `LUMINAIRE_NO` field (line 10), `NUM_LAMPS` set to `-1` (lamp not specified), free-form text in `LAMP_TYPE` such as `"1 x LED"`, and a UTF-8 BOM prepended to the file. A robust parser must tolerate empty text fields in lines 1–12 without skipping them.

> **Note on line numbering:** Lines 1–26 are fixed. From line 27 onward, line
> numbers shift depending on `N_SETS` (number of lamp sets). Each lamp set
> occupies exactly 6 consecutive lines. With N sets, lamp data spans lines
> 27 to 26+6N. All subsequent sections (direct ratios, angles, intensities)
> start at line 27+6N.

### Lamp sets example

The lamp data section is the only variable-length section of the header.
Each set always occupies exactly 6 lines.

**N_SETS = 1** (most common case — 32 lines of header before direct ratios):

```
...
26: 1            ← N_SETS
27: 1            ← NUM_LAMPS
28: LED-Module   ← LAMP_TYPE
29: 3500         ← LAMP_FLUX (lm)
30: 3000         ← CCT (K)
31: 80           ← CRI
32: 18.5         ← LAMP_WATT (W)
33: 0.0          ← DR[1]  (direct ratios start here)
...
42: 0.0          ← DR[10]
43: 0            ← C-angles start here
...
```

**N_SETS = 2** (lamp data spans lines 27–38, direct ratios start at line 39):

```
...
26: 2            ← N_SETS
27: 1            ← NUM_LAMPS  set 1
28: LED-Module   ← LAMP_TYPE  set 1
29: 3500         ← LAMP_FLUX  set 1 (lm)
30: 3000         ← CCT        set 1 (K)
31: 80           ← CRI        set 1
32: 18.5         ← LAMP_WATT  set 1 (W)
33: 1            ← NUM_LAMPS  set 2
34: LED-Module   ← LAMP_TYPE  set 2
35: 3500         ← LAMP_FLUX  set 2 (lm)
36: 4000         ← CCT        set 2 (K)
37: 80           ← CRI        set 2
38: 18.5         ← LAMP_WATT  set 2 (W)
39: 0.0          ← DR[1]  (direct ratios start here)
...
48: 0.0          ← DR[10]
49: 0            ← C-angles start here
...
```

## Symmetry (ISYM)

The ISYM field declares the symmetry of the luminaire's intensity distribution.

When ISYM ≠ 0, the intensity values stored in the file are **already symmetrised**
before writing: for each pair of mirror planes, the values are averaged. This serves
two purposes: reducing file size (fewer C-planes to store) and smoothing the measured
distribution to eliminate measurement artefacts.

`LdtReader` always expands the matrix to the full `[Mc × Ng]` size on read.

| ISYM | Symmetry | Symmetrisation rule (applied before writing) | C-planes written to file |
|------|----------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0 | None | No averaging — raw measured values | C=0° to C=360°−Dc (all Mc planes) |
| 1 | Full rotational | I_sym(γ) = average of I(C, γ) over all C-planes | C=0° only (1 plane) |
| 2 | About C0–C180 | I_sym(C, γ) = [ I(C, γ) + I(360°−C, γ) ] / 2 | C=0° to C=180° (inclusive) |
| 3 | About C90–C270 | I_sym(C, γ) = [ I(C, γ) + I(180°−C, γ) ] / 2 | C=270° down to C=90° *(decreasing order)* |
| 4 | Quadrant (C0–C180 and C90–C270) | I_sym(C, γ) = average of { I(C,γ), I(360°−C,γ), I(180°−C,γ), I(180°+C,γ) } | C=0° to C=90° (inclusive) |

> **ISYM=0:** Raw measured values, no averaging. This is the only mode where the full
> asymmetry of the luminaire is preserved.

> **ISYM=3 storage order:** C-planes are written in *decreasing* order from C=270° down
> to C=90°. This specific ordering is required for correct import in DIALux and Relux —
> using increasing order causes the intensity distribution to appear mirrored.

## Intensity values

Intensities are tabulated in **cd/klm** (candela per kilolumen of total lamp flux).
To convert to absolute candela:

```
I_abs(C, γ) [cd] = I_rel(C, γ) [cd/klm] × (num_lamps × Φ_lamp [lm]) / 1000 × conv_factor
```

> `num_lamps` is `h.num_lamps[0]`, `Φ_lamp` is `h.lamp_flux[0]` (lm), and
> `conv_factor` is `h.conv_factor` (1.0 in most files).
> When `num_lamps = 1` and `conv_factor = 1.0` the formula reduces to
> `I_abs = I_rel × Φ_lamp / 1000`, which is why single-lamp files appear correct
> even without the full formula.

Values are written one per line, sweeping all γ-angles for each C-plane in sequence.

## Encoding

EULUMDAT files use **ISO-8859-1** (Latin-1) encoding. `pyldt` reads files
in Latin-1 and writes in Latin-1.

Some tools (notably ERCO's ilumetrix software) prepend a **UTF-8 BOM**
(`0xEF 0xBB 0xBF`) to the file. `pyldt` detects and strips this BOM
automatically before decoding.
